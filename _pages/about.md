Hi! I am a final year undergraduate student in [Electrical Engineering](http://ee.iitd.ernet.in/) at [Indian Institue of Technology Delhi](http://www.iitd.ac.in/). My current research focuses on **self-supervised learning** for vision and improving **coreference resolution**. I have a strong inclination towards applications of AI for the betterment of society.

I am currently working with Prof. [Prathosh A.P.](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/) for completing my Bachelor's Thesis. In the summer of 2020, I interned with [Oracle India](oracle.com/in/index.html) in their [Digital Assistant](https://www.oracle.com/in/application-development/cloud-services/digital-assistant/) team. In the past, I have been fortunate enough to work with Prof. [Arpan Chattopadhyay](https://sites.google.com/site/arpanchattop/) as a research intern in 2019. 

Formerly, I was a core team member of [Robotics Club](http://roboticsclub.iitd.ac.in/) where we designed and developed drives(holonomic, mecanum etc), multi legged locomotive robots, ROS based differential drive etc.
